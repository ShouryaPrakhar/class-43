Elements of game design-
1. Characters-
a.pc-playing character and is controlled by the user.
For eg-pac-man
b.npc-non playing characters which is not controlled by the user
For example- pac-man ghosts

2. Goal-it is an objective  which has to be acheived  by the user
For example-collecting dots in pac-man

3. Game rules-Rules of a game that has to be followed by the user
For example-In pac-man-

a.If we touch ghosts we die
b.If we touch ghosts by power up,we get points
c.We cannot pass through the walls.
d.The ghosts are patrolling the maze
e.Five power ups,with which pac-man can eat the ghosts
f.Pac-man has three lives
g.We lose the game if our lives are out

4. Balance-It is the blance that the game is not too hard and nor too easy.
For example-in pac man-
a. 4 ghosts and 5 power ups
b. 2 openings on the the either sides
c. only 3 lives

5. Adaptivity-It is the charecteristic  of the game which makes it difficult as we progress.
For example-in pac-man-
It gets harder to eat the dots as we progress the the level.

6. Chances and skills-A good games has some elements of chance and some elements of skills
For example-In pac-man
The movement of the ghost is random and they can be disabled for a few seconds
We need to eat yellow dots on our way and strategize to win

7. Feedback-It gives the immediate position of our charecter currently in our game
For example-Pac-Man
We get to know our lives,score and sound

8. Story Line-The back story of current story of a game
For example-In pac-man
Pac man is hungry and is trying to eat the food while the ghosts are trying to stop pac-man
